## Description

This repository holds a basic implemenation of the normalized spectral community partitioning algorithm described by Andrew Ng in 2001. We applied our own minor modifications to balance the communities and decrease the overall cost.

## Running the code

To run the code simply type `python main.py` in the terminal (when in the directory of the file). This assumes you have python 3 and the necessary dependencies installed.
